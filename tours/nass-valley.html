                    I drove to Kitwanaga from Smithers with my bike and camped at the town's free 
                    campground. In the morning, the campground steward invited me to park my car in his 
                    driveway up the road. He told me 
                    about other tourists who've biked through, including mothers who brought their children
                    on their rides from Whitehorse. He mentioned that lots of weirdos live up the highway. 
                    I then headed north on the Stewart-Cassiar Highway. As soon as I 
                    reached the edge of town, I passed a coyote who watched me bike by. There were
                    a number of camps setup in the forest along the highway. A wierd man in an old
                    rusty Subaru Forester with Rubbermaid bins strapped to the roof and a hitch tray drove by me 
                    when I was about 50kms from Kitwanaga. About half an hour later, he came back my way,
                    hammered on his breaks about 200 meters in front of me, and said, "want a drink"
                    in a fast, nasally way when I approached his car. I don't even think he could have reached 
                    town before he turned around. I got serial killer vibes from him.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
                    I turned off of the Stewart-Cassiar Highway and headed west on the Cranberry Connector at 
                    Cranberry Junction. It was a logging road. I didn't see any cars until I was close 
                    to New Aiyansh. I was riding beneath massive trees and mountains the whole way and 
                    I noticed the landscape becoming increasingly coastal as I progessed. The sound of birds
                    defined this part of the tour for me because they gave me an auditory sense of 
                    the hieght of the forest canopy. It felt more like a jungle than a forest. I camped at Dragon Lake near Nass Camp for the night.
                    It was a beautiful site. I think it would be especially beautiful in the fall with all of
                    it's deciduous trees.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
                    The next day, I passed through the most beautiful native towns. New Aiyansh sits 
                    just to the east of the Nass Valley and is wrapped in mountains. The Nass Valley 
                    has wide open views of the lava beds and surrounding mountains. I rode through the
                    valley and toward Gingolx, the northern-most coastal community in BC. The road from New Aiyansh to Gingolx might be the most beautiful road in Canada.
                    I saw a moose jogging through dense forest along the side of the road, a grizzly bear
                    eating a porcupine carcus&mdash;which was covered in bright red 
                    blood&mdash;and lots of living porcupines and black bears with shiny coats. When I 
                    reached Gingolx, I hiked up the lookout trail and watched eagles fly. I turned back 
                    toward the east and camped beside a luxury gravel pit off of the highway for the night. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
                    The first part of my third day looked much like my second day. I biked back to the Nass Valley, but 
                    I turned south toward Terrace when I got to New Aiyansh. This opened up into a 
                    another world. I biked by the sunken forest where a river runs through the trees.
                    There were lots of waterfalls. The water reflected many tones of green and blue
                    and a muddy grey. The entire area around Rosswood felt like a permanent forestry camp. 
                    I camped on a beach on Kitsumkalum Lake where everything looked black, white, and blue.
                    It was like being in a sketch.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
                    On my last day of the tour, I biked to Terrace and ordered a sandwich and cappuccino 
                    at Bert's Delicatessen. While waiting, I spoke to another person who I would
                    coincidentally met again a few weeks later in Telkwa. Northern BC has lots of land and 
                    few people, which is different. 
                    I took my order from Bert and sat in the park where I consumed both 
                    items. When finished, I watched people
                    walking around the farmers market in the park for a while, got on my bike, and returned to 
                    my car in Kitwanga. This was a very lucrative bicycle tour.
