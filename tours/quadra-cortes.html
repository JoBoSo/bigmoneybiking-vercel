                    Cortes Island is my favorite island. It is magical. When I arrived at the beach in Mansons 
                    Landing, I saw a bunch of pontoon boats sitting on the rocky floor of an empty tide 
                    pool to one side of the beach with cottages sitting on cliffs above them. I was so 
                    confused until I saw the ocean fill it back up with water and bring the pontoons 
                    with it later that day. In the bay to the other side of the beach were a bunch of 
                    anchored sailboats and people lounging.
                    In the main section of the village, there was a café with a big 
                    porch across the front where three guys with dreadlocks were smoking a bong 
                    like it was everybody’s business. Across the street, there was an organic farm 
                    with a beautiful symmetrical garden with lots of purple flowers. At the tables 
                    beside that garden were some middle-aged women dressed in black clothes, looking 
                    kind of like witches. 
                    It was quite bustling.

                    Quadra was nice as well. It’s more developed than Cortes. The highlight of Quadra 
                    was seeing the sailboats floating in the bay by Rebecca Spit because they were 
                    little white specks surrounded by dark blue ocean with the mountains on the sunshine 
                    coast in the background. On my way back to Campbell River from Quadra, 
                    I got the two-piece ling-cod dinner from the fish and chips restaurant by the dock 
                    and ate it on the ferry in the presence of Her Majesty, The Queen of England’s 
                    picture, which hangs on every ferry I’ve been on in BC to protect travellers 
                    from the whims of the Pacific. God bless her.
