                    My tour of North Vancouver Island spanned roads from Courtenay to San Josef Bay 
                    in Cape Scott Provincial Park. I spent my first day biking towards Burnt Beach 
                    Rec Site above Campbell River. I made it to Elk Creek Rec Site near Sayward on 
                    my second day where I camped for two nights hoping that the rain would pass, 
                    but it didn’t because I learned It only ever rains in Sayward.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
                    When I got back to it, I pushed on toward Woss. Woss isn’t much more than a 
                    gas station with a deteriorating motel next door where stacks of beer bottles 
                    and drunk ATVers occupy the porch. I sat at the bench in front of the gas 
                    station after I bought stale cookies and beef jerky from the store. The 
                    Christmas tree shaped ash tray was full of roaches. Two VW Vanagon vans 
                    that were rebuilt for camping and off-roading pulled in while the ATVers 
                    shouted back and forth at one another, drank beer, and smoked cigarettes 
                    next door. I continued on to Nimpkish Lake Rec Site.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
                    On day five, the bicycle tour continued. I sat in the park in Port McNeill 
                    and charged my phone while my cashews lay in my pack, exposed to the skies.
                     The crows noticed. They stole my cashews and spread them all over the park. 
                     Once I passed Port Hardy that afternoon, I was onto the logging roads that 
                     led to Cape Scott. I followed a trail to a beach on Nahwitti 
                     Lake where I camped that night.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
                    The next day was a grind up the forest service roads to Cape Scott. 
                    I met a man and his daughter on motorcycles. The man was developing a 
                    motorcycle route called the North Island 1000. 
                    The logging trucks ripped up and down the road and threw dust in my eyes. 
                    I saw a few bears along the way. When I arrived at the park, I biked along 
                    the Cape Scott Trail toward San Josef Bay and camped on the beach. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
                    My return trip was completed in just two days. I returned to Nimpkish Lake for 
                    another night, then biked 213 kms home the next day. If I had a dollar for every 
                    kilometer I’ve biked, I could bike even further.
